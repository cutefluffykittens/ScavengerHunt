# ScavengerHunt
The ScavengerHunt program is a django application that allows for the creating and play through of a scavenger hunt game. The program allows for game creation with teams, landmark locations, clues, question/answer verification, and various game settings like penalties. Teams interact with the program by receiving clues and answering the verification questions.

## CuteFluffyKittens Group
This project was completed as a class assignment for CS361 - Intro to Software Engineering at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee during the Fall 2017 semester. Our group included Mitchell Kossoris, Amanda Bruessel, Cody Kuchinski, and Kayla Rodenbeck, under the supervision of Professor Jayson Rock.

## History of Project
We were given three sprints (about 6 weeks) to complete our project. 
* The first iteration (first sprint) was a simple command line interface, where a user could type a command with some arguments and the program would execute that command.
* The second iteration (second sprint) was to convert our command line interface into a django application. The application was essentially just a web-based command line interface.
* Our final iteration (third sprint) is our current project, with a simple but usable user interface using Bootstrap 4, database integration, and basic unencrypted login support.
